# mapping

UAV mission planning using GIS maps to identify hazards, no fly zones, safety locations and control zones.

Underlying principles described in:

H. Goudarzi, D. Hine and A. Richards, "Mission Automation for Drone Inspection in Congested Environments," 2019 Workshop on Research, Education and Development of Unmanned Aerial Systems (RED UAS), Cranfield, United Kingdom, 2019, pp. 305-314.

This release uses open source data from [openstreetmap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).  
Data from Ordnance Survey [Digimap](https://digimap.edina.ac.uk/) can also be used, with appropriate coordinate transformations.

The `bristol_example_osm` notebook works through the example, including installation instructions for Python dependencies.

## FLY SAFE

The example does not imply permission to fly in the locations shown.
While the software is intended to promote safe drone flight, use of this software does not in itself guarantee safe or legal drone operation.
Follow the [drone code](https://dronesafe.uk/drone-code/).
